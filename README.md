# CS312-AlgortihtmsDesign-AnalysisProjects
These are all projects from my CS 312. The code for all the GUIs was provided for me to help me to test my algorithms. Below are brief descriptions of each project and the files that I actually wrote/edited.
Project 1: A prime number tester using Fermat's theorem (look at fermat.py)
Project 2: A convex hull drawer (look at convex_hull.py)
Project 3: An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue with an array and a binary heap implementaion. (Look under venv)
Project 4: A program that illustrates gene sequencing.
